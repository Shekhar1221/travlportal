                Many of the flights and flight-inclusive holidays on this website are financially protected by the ATOLscheme. But ATOLprotection does not apply to all holiday and travel services listed on this website.
                Please ask us to confirm what protection may apply to your booking. If you do not receive an ATOLCertificate then the booking will not be ATOLprotected. If you do receive an ATOLCertificate but all
                the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts will not be ATOLprotected. If you have booked a flight only where the ticket is not issued immediately, your flight will be protected under ourATOL.
